    The development of a landing page for SoulDance, a small dance school, involved a thorough understanding of the target audience and the unique selling points of the school. As a former marketeer I focused on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly page that would effectively showcase the school's offerings. The page includes clear and concise information about the school's mission and class schedule. I also added a contact form for inquiries. With its engaging design and easy navigation, the landing page is working as a platform to attract new students and collect leads to SoulDance.

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
## Biggest Learnings 📖

* []() Understanding TypeScript: It took some time to understand how to correctly implement TypeScript in the codebase, but once understood it helped to ensure code consistency and reduce errors.
* []() Utilizing Tailwind: Making it easier to create consistent and responsive design. Using Tailwind allowed for efficient design implementation and faster development time.
* []() React.js Fundamentals: It was important to have a good understanding of React.js concepts such as components, state and props to effectively build the landing page.
* []() Testing and debugging: TypeScript, Tailwind and React.js can be complex and it was necessary to spend a lot of time testing and debugging the code to ensure everything was working correctly.


#### It also helped me to learn more about Web Design:
* []() Understanding Vectors: Illustrator and Photoshop both have the ability to create vector graphics which are important for web design as they are scalable and can be resized without losing quality. Understanding the difference between vectors and raster graphics was key for creating SVG and vector graphics for the website.
* []() Manipulating images: It was important to learn how to use tools such as the clone stamp, healing brush, and filters to enhance images and make them more visually appealing.
* []() Exporting and optimizing images: Knowing how to export and optimize images for the web was crucial to ensure that they loaded quickly and looked great on the website. This included adjusting the resolution, file format, and compression settings.
* []() Creating icons and graphics: It was essential to learn how to create these elements and to understand how to use them effectively in the design.
